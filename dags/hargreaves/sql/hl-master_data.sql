The Fund invests globally at least 70% of its total assets in the equity securities (e.g. shares) of companies, with no market capitalisation limits. Market capitalisation is the share price of the company multiplied by the number of shares issued. The investment adviser (IA) may use financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for investment purposes in order to achieve the investment objective of the Fund, and/or to reduce risk within the Fund\x92s portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income. The Fund may, via FDIs, generate varying amounts of market leverage (i.e. where the Fund gains market exposure in excess of the value of its assets). The Fund is actively managed, and the IA has discretion to select the Funds investments. In doing so the IA will refer to the\xa0MSCI All Country World Index when constructing the Fund\x92s portfolio, and also for risk management purposes to ensure that the active risk (i.e. degree of deviation from the index) taken by the Fund remains appropriate given the Fund\x92s investment objective and policy. The IA is not bound by the components or weighting of the Index when selecting investments. The IA may also use its discretion to invest in securities not included in the Index in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities.

The Fund invests predominantly in fixed income (FI) securities (such as bonds) that make up the Index. The Index is comprised of local currency denominated fixed rate FI securities issued by emerging market sovereign and quasi-sovereign entities. Quasi-sovereign entities must be 100% guaranteed or 100% owned by the relevant sovereign entity. At the time of purchase, the FI securities may be investment grade (i.e. meet a specified level of credit worthiness) non-investment grade or unrated. Below investment grade FI securities may constitute a significant portion of the Index. Such securities may be rated or are deemed by the investment manager to be of equivalent rating. If the credit rating of a FI security is downgraded, the Fund may continue to hold this, until it is practicable to sell the position. The Fund uses optimising techniques to achieve a similar return to its Index. These may include the strategic selection of certain securities that make up the Index and may also include the use of financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets). FDIs may be used for efficient portfolio management (i.e to reduce risk within the Fund\x92s portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income) or to provide protection against exchange rate risk. The Fund may also engage in short-term secured lending of its investments to certain eligible third parties. This is used as a means of generating additional income and to off-set the costs of the Fund. Recommendation: This Fund may not be appropriate for short-term investment.
