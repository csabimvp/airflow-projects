The Fund invests in shares of listed companies which the
Manager believes will provide above-average returns. The
Fund invests in companies of any size and based anywhere in
the world (including emerging markets). The Manager seeks
to reduce the impact on the Fund of fluctuations in value of
equity markets by investing in bonds issued by developed
market governments. The Funds typical asset mix ranges
between 60  85% of its Net Asset Value in shares, with the
remainder being mainly in bonds and cash.
The Manager invests in issuers of shares of listed companies
which it believes have leading or improving environmental,
social and governance (ESG) practices. These companies will
either demonstrate leadership on sustainability issues (such
as promoting better social outcomes, increasing the amount
of renewable energy and using the planets resources more
sustainably and increased digitalisation) through strong ESG
practices (leaders) or will have shown a clear commitment
to improve their ESG practices (companies in transition).
The majority of the Funds equity investments (50% or more)
will be in leaders. The Manager will actively engage on
sustainability issues with a particular focus on companies in
transition. When selecting shares, the Manager will also
analyse a companys financial status, quality of its
management, expected profitability and prospects for
growth.
In selecting investments(bonds and shares), the Manager will
take into account the companys or issuers ESG score as one
factor within its broader analysis of the company or issuer to
identify investments which are expected to generate
long-term capital growth. The Manager believes that
companies and issuers with higher or improving ESG scores
manage risk associated with ESG issues more effectively,
contributing to better financial performance of such
companies and issuers in the long term. ESG scores are
obtained from our selected external provider(s) as detailed in
the Responsible Investment section above. The

The Fund invests globally in the full range of assets in which a UCITS may invest, including equity securities (e.g. shares), fixed income (FI) securities (such as bonds), funds, cash, deposits and money market instruments (i.e. debt securities with short term maturities). The Fund is actively managed and the asset classes and the extent to which the Fund is invested in these may vary without limit depending on market conditions andother factors at the investment advisers (IA) discretion. In selecting these, the IA may take into consideration a composite benchmark comprising MSCI World Index(70%) and the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index USD Hedged (30%) (the Index) when constructing the Funds portfolio, and for risk managementpurposes to ensure that the active risk (i.e. degree of deviation from the Index) taken by the Fund remains appropriate given the Funds investment objective andpolicy. Whilst the Index is used by the IA in constructing the portfolio of the Fund, the IA is not bound by its components or weighting when selecting investments. TheIA may also use its discretion to invest in securities not included in the Index in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities. The Funds portfolioholdings are expected to deviate materially from the Index. The components of the Index (i.e. MSCI World Index and Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate BondIndex US Hedged) may be quoted separately in marketing material related to the Fund. The Funds investments in FI securities and money market instruments may be issued by governments, government agencies, companies and supranationals (e.g. the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development). These may include securities with a relatively low credit rating or which are unrated. The assets held by the Fund may be denominated in a wide variety of currencies. The Fund distributes income gross of expenses. The IA may use financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for investment purposes in order to achieve the investment objective of the Fund, and/or to reduce risk within the Funds portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income. The Fund may, via FDIs, generate varying amounts of market leverage (i.e. where the Fund gains market exposure in excess of the value of its assets).

The Fund invests globally at least 70% of its total assets in the equity securities (e.g. shares) of companies, with no market capitalisation limits. Market capitalisation is the share price of the company multiplied by the number of shares issued. The investment adviser (IA) may use financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for investment purposes in order to achieve the investment objective of the Fund, and/or to reduce risk within the Funds portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income. The Fund may, via FDIs, generate varying amounts of market leverage (i.e. where the Fund gains market exposure in excess of the value of its assets). The Fund is actively managed, and the IA has discretion to select the Funds investments. In doing so the IA will refer to the MSCI All Country World Index when constructing the Funds portfolio, and also for risk management purposes to ensure that the active risk (i.e. degree of deviation from the index) taken by the Fund remains appropriate given the Funds investment objective and policy. The IA is not bound by the components or weighting of the Index when selecting investments.

BFBFYB7,"The Fund is a fund in a series of MyMap funds and the number allocated to the Fund does not directly relate to the level of risk or return within the Fund and is used simply to differentiate the Fund from the other MyMap branded funds in the BlackRock Investment Funds umbrella. The Fund aims to achieve a total return on your investment over five year periods, through a combination of capital growth and income, while maintaining a pre-defined risk profile within 6%-9%, as measured by the Funds annualised volatility over the five year period. Volatility is the measure of fluctuations of the returns of a given investment. Generally, the higher the volatility, the riskier the investment. The Fund will be actively managed with the aim of delivering a total return over a specified period, while maintaining a pre-defined risk profile. However, there can be no guarantee that the Fund will maintain the target level of risk and the Funds potential gains and losses are likely to be constrained by the aim to stay within the predefined risk profile. The Funds capital is at risk. The Fund will seek to achieve its investment exposure by investing predominantly (more than 80% of the Funds net asset value) in units of other funds, including, but not limited to exchange traded funds and other index funds managed by an affiliate of the BlackRock Group. At any one time, a substantial amount, or even all of the Funds assets may be held in units of other funds. The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by obtaining indirect exposure to a variety of asset classes globally, including equity securities (e.g. shares), fixed income securities (such as corporate bonds and government bonds), cash and near cash instruments (such as money market instruments (i.e. debt securities with short term maturities)). The Fund will seek to stay within the stated risk profile by varying its asset allocations (i.e. mix of assets) in different market conditions. Given the lower risk profile of the Fund, under normal market conditions the Fund will seek a greater exposure to fixed income securities (which are generally considered to be less risky compared to equity securities), compared to a fund with a higher risk profile which would seek to have a greater exposure to equity securities (which are generally considered to be more risky compared to fixed income securities). The Fund may hold up to 15% of the Funds net asset value indirectly in alternative asset classes (such as, but not limited to real estate and commodities (i.e. precious metals)). The Fund may also invest directly in financial derivative instruments (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) cash, near cash instruments, and forward transactions, for investment purposes and for the purposes of efficient portfolio management, including to hedge currency exposure to enable the Fund to profit from changes in currency exchange rates against the base currency of the Fund. The Fund is actively managed without reference to a benchmark meaning that the investment manager has absolute discretion to choose the Funds investments and is not constrained by any target, comparator or performance benchmark. Recommendation: This Fund may not be appropriate for short-term investment. Your units will be income units (i.e. dividend income will be paid semi-annually on the units).",0.17,0.0,117.37100000000001,QCQG,0,2075,BlackRock,1,BlackRock MyMap 3 (Class D),BlackRock MyMap 3 (Class D),77.3,2.9,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1,1,GBP,2019-05-28,100.0,100.0,0.17,58.0,117.37100000000001,0.05,Annually,Dividend,0.17,5.53,0.0,5.53,6.51,-3.47,8.49,-2.96,-0.6,4.21,9.71,0.62,1,25.0,157,Volatility Managed,0,1,0.17,1,Accumulation,2025-05-28,2025-05-28,Daily,2.9,0

The Fund will be actively managed with the aim of delivering a total return over a specified period, while maintaining a pre-defined risk profile. However, there can be no guarantee that the Fund will maintain the target level of risk and the Funds potential gains and losses are likely to be constrained by the aim to stay within the predefined risk profile. The Funds capital is at risk. The Fund will seek to achieve its investment exposure by investing predominantly (more than 80% of the Funds net asset value) in units of other funds, including, but not limited to exchange traded funds and other index funds managed by an affiliate of the BlackRock Group. At any one time, a substantial amount, or even all of the Funds assets may be held in units of other funds. The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by obtaining indirect exposure to a variety of asset classes globally, including equity securities (e.g. shares), fixed income securities (such as corporate bonds and government bonds), cash and near cash instruments (such as money market instruments (i.e. debt securities with short term maturities)). The Fund will seek to stay within the stated risk profile by varying its asset allocations (i.e. mix of assets) in different market conditions. Given the lower risk profile of the Fund, under normal market conditions the Fund will seek a greater exposure to fixed income securities (which are generally considered to be less risky compared to equity securities), compared to a fund with a higher risk profile which would seek to have a greater exposure to equity securities (which are generally considered to be more risky compared to fixed income securities). The Fund may hold up to 15% of the Funds net asset value indirectly in alternative asset classes (such as, but not limited to real estate and commodities (i.e. precious metals)). The Fund may also invest directly in financial derivative instruments (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) cash, near cash instruments, and forward transactions, for investment purposes and for the purposes of efficient portfolio management, including to hedge currency exposure to enable the Fund to profit from changes in currency exchange rates against the base currency of the Fund. The Fund is actively managed without reference to a benchmark meaning that the investment manager has absolute discretion to choose the Funds investments and is not constrained by any target, comparator or performance benchmark. Recommendation: This Fund may not be appropriate for short-term investment. Your units will be income units (i.e. dividend income will be paid semi-annually on the units).",0.17,0.0,106.003,QD4E,0,2075,BlackRock,1,BlackRock MyMap 3 (Class D),BlackRock MyMap 3 (Class D),77.3,2.9,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1,1,GBP,2019-05-28,100.0,100.0,0.17,58.0,106.003,0.05,Annually,Dividend,0.17,5.53,0.0,5.53,6.51,-3.47,8.49,-2.97,-0.6,4.2,9.69,0.62,1,25.0,157,Volatility Managed,0,1,0.17,1,Income,2025-05-28,2025-05-28,Daily,2.9,0

B88S829,The aim of the Fund is to provide income with the potential to grow the amount you invested as well. The Fund invests at least two-thirds of its assets in currencies of emerging markets and bonds (which are similar to a loan and pay a fixed or variable interest rate) issued by companies and/or governments in emerging markets or companies that have significant operations in emerging markets. Emerging markets are countries where economic and political risk can be significant and where governance and regulation may not be well developed. The Fund invests directly in these assets or by using derivatives. Derivatives are sophisticated investment instruments linked to the rise and fall of the price of other assets. The Fund may also make use of short selling techniques (which are designed to make a profit from falling prices) and leverage (which increases the effect that a change in the price of an investment has on the Funds value).

However, over short time periods, the funds performance may be close to the Index, depending on market conditions.

BJVDYJ7,"The fund aims to achieve long-term capital growth from a portfolio primarily made up of equity securities of companies throughout the world including emerging markets. The fund aims to invest in multiple long-term market themes by investing in securities that may benefit from structural and/or secular (i.e. long term and not cyclical) changes in economic and social factors, such as disruptive technologies, demographics and climate change. Secular changes generally last for ten years or more and can lead to structural changes. 
Disruptive technologies are innovations that meaningfully change consumer, industry or company behavior. Demographic trends are long-term dynamics including those related to ageing population (including companies relating to healthcare and retirement consumption), growth of the middle class (companies exposed to increased consumption, increasing financial services and urbanization), and population growth (including companies exposed to scarcity of resources and need for improving productivity and automation). The Investment Manager has the discretion on the choice of themes the fund invests in. 
The Investment Manager may invest in any country and in any currency and is not restricted in its choice of companies either by size or industry.
The fund may invest its net assets directly in China A and B Shares.

BD8PL15,"The fund aims to achieve income and long-term capital growth principally through investments in income producing equity securities globally. The Investment Manager will target investments which it believes offer attractive dividend yields in addition to price appreciation. As this fund may invest globally, it may be exposed to countries considered to be emerging markets.
A minimum of 50% of the funds net assets will be invested in securities deemed to maintain sustainable characteristics, as described in the section entitled 1.3.2(a) Fidelity Sustainable Investing Framework above. 
The fund is actively managed and aims to provide income and capital growth. Income will typically be in excess of MSCI ACWI Index (the Index). The Index constituents are representative of the type of companies the fund invests in. The funds performance can be assessed against its Index. 
The Investment Manager has a wide range of discretion relative to the Index. While the fund will hold assets that are components of the Index, it also is expected to invest in issuers, sectors, countries and security types that have different weightings from, and may not be included in the Index in order to take advantage of investment opportunities. It is expected that over long time periods, the funds performance will differ from the Index.

BKFVZC4,"The Fund aims to achieve a total return on your investment, through a combination of capital growth and income, which reflects the return of the J.P. Morgan Government Bond Index - Emerging Market Global Diversified Index, the Funds benchmark index (Index). The Fund invests predominantly in fixed income (FI) securities (such as bonds) that make up the Index. The Index is comprised of local currency denominated fixed rate FI securities issued by emerging market sovereign and quasi-sovereign entities. Quasi-sovereign entities must be 100% guaranteed or 100% owned by the relevant sovereign entity. At the time of purchase, the FI securities may be investment grade (i.e. meet a specified level of credit worthiness) non-investment grade or unrated. Below investment grade FI securities may constitute a significant portion of the Index. Such securities may be rated or are deemed by the investment manager to be of equivalent rating. If the credit rating of a FI security is downgraded, the Fund may continue to hold this, until it is practicable to sell the position. The Fund uses optimising techniques to achieve a similar return to its Index. These may include the strategic selection of certain securities that make up the Index and may also include the use of financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets). FDIs may be used for efficient portfolio management (i.e to reduce risk within the Funds portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income) or to provide protection against exchange rate risk. The Fund may also engage in short-term secured lending of its investments to certain eligible third parties. This is used as a means of generating additional income and to off-set the costs of the Fund. Recommendation: This Fund may not be appropriate for short-term investment. Your shares will be accumulating shares (i.e. dividend income will be included in their value).",0.25,0.0,767.3,QQ6G,0,2075,BlackRock,6,iShares Emerging Markets Local Government Bond,BlackRock Emerging Markets Local Government Bond Index (D GB,1709.1,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,1,1,USD,2018-05-04,100.0,100.0,0.25,369.0,770.5,0.1,N/a,Dividend,-0.01,2.24,0.0,2.24,1.82,5.01,9.31,-5.65,-1.03,-6.86,-3.94,0.77,1,25.0,48,Unclassified,0,1,0.25,0,Income,2025-05-28,2025-05-27,Daily,0.0,0

The Fund may also invest in other assets including cash and money market instruments. The investment manager may use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk, to manage the Fund more efficiently, or to generate additional capital or income for the Fund. The Fund is actively managed with reference to the MSCI ACWI Technology Index, which is broadly representative of the companies in which it may invest, as this forms the basis of the Funds performance target.

The Fund may also invest in shares in companies which are reasonably expected to become part of the Benchmark Index in the near future or are an alternative to a constituent of the Benchmark Index and collective investment schemes, including those managed or operated by the Manager or an associate of the Manager as well as money market instruments (such as treasury bills), cash and permitted deposits.
The Fund may only use derivatives for Efficient Portfolio Management purposes.

The Manager will aim to identify a combination of investments that are expected to produce high income (relative to that generally available from the investments permitted), together with the potential for capital growth.

to generate capital growth over the long term (5 years). 
The company will aim to meet its objective by typically 
investing at least 70% in a concentrated portfolio of UK

may be less than 70% due to liquidity or market 
conditions). In addition to investing in equities, the

(that provide exposure to investments including equities

advised by the ACD or Investment Manager), money

BYW8T68,"The investment objective of the VT AJ Bell Passive Adventurous is to achieve long-term capital growth with a high level of exposure to higher risk assets such as equities and a low level of exposure to lower risk assets such as cash and fixed income. The Fund will seek to achieve its objective by investing primarily in listed securities (ETFs, futures, fixed income securities, money market instruments and equities), but also, particularly in the early stages of the Funds growth, in other collective investment schemes. The Fund will invest, wherever practically possible, in passive investments, which are instruments and investment strategies that aim to track the performance of various financial indices.
